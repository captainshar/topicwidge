<!-- So, this page needs to render the form, and also show results once the form is submitted -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>Topic Widge</title>
<body>

<h1>Enter Topic</h1>

<!-- Search form -->
<form  method="GET" action="index.php"  id="searchform"> 
	<input  type="text" name="topic"> 
	<input  type="submit" name="submit" value="Search"> 
</form>

<!-- logic to check form submission and extract the variable 

this is handled by the line in my controller, index.php:

// Catch the topic variable from the submission form in index.twig
$topic = $request->query->get('topic');

-->

<!-- and then here we render the recent search terms and the external page results

That's it? We just use the variables from the return $app['twig']->render('index.twig', []); block now? -->

<p>You searched for the topic {{ topic }}.</p>

<!-- TODO: Tracking my search terms in an array -->

{% for topic_recent in topics_recent %}
    * {{ topic_recent }}
{% else %}
    Please enter a search term.
{% endfor %}
