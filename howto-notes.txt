^to start the project. Visit localhost:3000 to see the app

~~~

After creating a new Rails app,

Go to config/routes.rb and start adding “routes” which respond to URLs that you visit, and they look like this:

root to: "home#index"

Where root refers to the “index page” of the site, and home is the name of a controller and index is the name of a method in that controller.

root is a method that takes a hash of “to” and some value. Ruby often uses hashes of known keys and unknown values to supply information to its methods.


Then, make sure there is a corresponding controller!

Example:

Create controllers/home_controller.rb

This should contain the method that was referenced in routes.rb; for example, index


Adding another route to routes.rb, ABOVE the root one:

get "search", to: "home#index"

This uses the URL /search and uses the same index method in the home_controller.rb controller



If there’s no matching method for a controller, it will go to /app/views/<controller_name> where controller_name is the short name of the controller, and render an index file from there, e.g. index.html.erb.


Useful website for testing javascript on the fly:

https://jsfiddle.net/#run

Add our index.html.erb and our home.js


Note: the javascript was loading before the form, so we had to wrap it in

$(document).ready(function() {
 });


Use this URL to test search terms:

http://localhost:3000/api/community?term=foo

Right now this is using the code from app/controllers/api/communities_controller.rb

And it shows a JSON output of the term

~~~~~~

On to the community search!

Use Nokogiri to scrape the community page and have app/controllers/api/communities_controller.rb show the results from that page.

After installing Nokogiri, adding it to my Gemfile, and running bundle install,

I was able to add the following lines to app/controllers/api/communities_controller.rb:


    require 'open-uri'
    @doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("https://www.digitalocean.com/community/search?q=coreos"))
    articles = @doc.css("div.feedable-details a")
    puts articles

This uses a request to a static page, https://www.digitalocean.com/community/search?q=coreos.

TODO: Sub in that “term” variable!

It grabs the page as a Nokogiri object, and then I searched through it for items related to the CSS descriptor feedable-details.

I don’t remember how to show things on the page yet so I’m just using “puts” to send the output to the terminal.

So far it looks like I got what I wanted in the terminal!

TODO: Clean up the requested output a little more, and figure out how to properly display it on the app web page. (Probably need a view for this?)

TODO: Parse multiple web pages from the community site
