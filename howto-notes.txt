After creating a new Rails app,

Go to config/routes.rb and start adding “routes” which respond to URLs that you visit, and they look like this:

root to: "home#index"

Where root refers to the “index page” of the site, and home is the name of a controller and index is the name of a method in that controller.

root is a method that takes a hash of “to” and some value. Ruby often uses hashes of known keys and unknown values to supply information to its methods.


Then, make sure there is a corresponding controller!

Example:

Create controllers/home_controller.rb

This should contain the method that was referenced in routes.rb; for example, index


Adding another route to routes.rb, ABOVE the root one:

get "search", to: "home#index"

This uses the URL /search and uses the same index method in the home_controller.rb controller



If there’s no matching method for a controller, it will go to /app/views/<controller_name> where controller_name is the short name of the controller, and render an index file from there, e.g. index.html.erb.


Useful website for testing javascript on the fly:

Add our index.html.erb and our home.js


Note: the javascript was loading before the form, so we had to wrap it in

$(document).ready(function() {
 });
