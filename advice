Project notes

i can only speak from my own preferences

Michael Schenck [1:43 PM]
but I use C (or Java if I absolutely *have* to) when performance is my number one concern

Michael Schenck [1:45 PM]
i usually use a _rapid development_ language such a python/ruby for most things

Michael Schenck [1:45 PM]
sometimes, i'll even start with ruby, even if i plan to go with C, just to rapid prototype an idea

Michael Schenck [1:46 PM]
I believe all of those services offer a REST API, so after picking a language, the next step I'd go with is picking an HTTP client library that provides functionality to work with all of those APIs

Michael Schenck [1:47 PM]
then, since that set of services may grow in the future, you might want to make support of each of them modularly, like maybe a different source file per API service

Michael Schenck [1:48 PM]
that also helps maintainability.  one might have a major API version change, so you might just treat the new version as a new _provider

if you do like C, you might also like Go

Michael Schenck [1:49 PM]
it feels pretty familiar to C, but is faster (less verbose) to code

Michael Schenck [1:49 PM]
oh!  and you can parallelize more easily

Michael Schenck [1:49 PM]
(not to convolute your language decision any further)
